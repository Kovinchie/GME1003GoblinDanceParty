first, I apologize for not using your beautiful goblin. I replaced him...

I am completing all 1 to 6 tasks, AND I'm not using AI; instead, I'm just 
gonna search up things I wanna figure out.

i decided every time i put down my code to do something else i would save or after finishing a part of the 
code i would save and push

Decisions made:
I randomized the star image from just a single image to a list of random like how everything else was done 
also made a cool gamer play games, then sized a background for the place

Problems I had:
the custom star replacement i made was small so i used the scale part in the code but the scale messing 
stuff up the center part with the pieces the fix is just gonna be to make it bigger images, but I did try 
to use numbers and stuff to figure out the placement I thing i need the scale to times the width and height
but am taking the easy method
